# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, Driverpass wanted to create a web-based system that would allow driving students to pass their driving test through the implementation of study guides and exams. The system would allow students to take tests, study, and schedule a one to one with a driving instructor. 

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did a good job gathering the reuqired materials and research, as well as design the uml diagrams that accurately depicts the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise the Class uml diagram as it was not implemented in this system. I would organize the classes by the different roles a user can take and by the use cases that may requre several objects to be created. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When creating the system i ensured to take proper notes from the clients interview. I created a system that met the requirements specified by the client and made sure to include any features that may be necessary to implement in order to achieve the users requests. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing the system to guarantee user satisfaction. The users will be the ones to interact withthe system. Ensuring the system meets their need will encourage the client to comeback to use whenever they would like to build another system or can refer us if they have somebody that would like to build a system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by focusing on the users needs and ensuring the clients requirements are being met. I also try to brake down the system to accurately represent the system and how it will be implemented. I will be using these stratagies and techniques in the future when designing a system.
